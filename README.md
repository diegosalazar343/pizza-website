## Description
_{ This project was intended to display our knowledge and skills that we developed in week four. In this project I created a pizza parlor website that made it possible for customers to create their own pizza. In order to accomplish this task I had to create a pizza constructor with properties for toppings and size. }_

## Behavior
* _Spec: Create select boxes for pizza toppings.
Input: "Sauces: red sauce, white sauce, no sauce"
Output:"select: red sauce"

* _Spec: Create checkboxes for option that can have more than one pizza topping.
Input: "Meats: bacon, sausage, ham, chicken"
Output:"select: ham and chicken"

* _Spec: Create values for each option that will determine the total price."
Input: "Sauces: "red sauce - value 1, white sauce - value 1, no sauce - value 0."
Output: select: "red sauce - value 1"

* _Spec: Add those values together to find out how much the total pizza cost
Input: "pizza: "red sauce - value 1; stuffed crust -value 2; normal cheese - value 1; ham and sausage value 2; mushrooms - value 1."
Output: "pizza total- 6 dollars

* _Spec: Have three values and if total values are >= to them then the total pizza will cost that much.
Input: "if >= 7, if else >=14, else >=20
Output: pizza value total is 10 --> pizza total cost is 14 dollars.
